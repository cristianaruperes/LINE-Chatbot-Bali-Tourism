# LINE Chatbot for travel in Bali, Indonesia

I have developed a chatbot within the LINE app that assists users in discovering everything about Paris, from famous landmarks and museums to restaurants and local culture. This chatbot is designed to provide quick and accurate responses to any inquiries, making it easier for both tourists and locals to navigate and explore the city. Whether someone is looking for must-visit attractions, transportation tips, or the best places to eat, the chatbot offers helpful information in real-time, enhancing the user experience and helping people make the most of their time
